Why choose us
#WE ARE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERTS

 ###What does Appranix do?
 
Appranix radically simplifies the modern software supply chain with its unique Application Centric Automation (AcA) service. Appranix AcA allows organizations to compose applications, services, platforms, configurations and data as one assembly across various infrastructure so they can be deployed, managed and recalled all from an application centric view. The net result is an order of magnitude of agility and availability while simultaneously decreasing the costs for the complex enterprise and cloud native software supply chain.

Just like modern manufacturing, software development, delivery and operations are moving to a standardized, flexible and on-demand (JIT) model. Standardized infrastructure resources, platform services and components from multiple cloud vendors have enabled rapid software supply chain for the enterprise applications, SaaS hosted in the data center or public clouds. Serverless computing and microservices are revolutionizing development of green field applications. Application mobility and service composition are becoming key requirements. All of these flexibility and rapid development have enormously increased the complexity and cost of the software supply chain requiring an Application Centric not an infrastructure centric approach for developing, delivering and operating the modern software platforms.

#APPRANIX ACA STREAMLINES THE SUPPLY CHAIN

- Features
-----------

#Application Centric Services Composition
 
Appranix AcA allows customers to compose both stack and graph based applications and services. Applications can be integrated and delivered from multiple-cloud service providers. Composed applications are represented as “Assemblies” ready to be deployed on to any cloud IaaS and PaaS, and can be moved with flexible service mobility.

#Application Centric Data Orchestration
 
Optimization of modern supply chain can’t be achieved without orchestrating data along with infrastructure and applications. In order to release applications faster and reproduce problems faster, data needs to be captured and moved from one environment to another efficiently without compromising security. DevOps can’t be efficient without current data for testing, pre-production or reproduction of customer bugs. Appranix AcA makes it possible a seamless way to capture, move the data across different environments all from application centric approach.

#Application Centric Cost Management
 
Governance and cost management on clouds without an application centric approach is very much limited to reports and one-way conversation. It’s plain impossible to identify the most cost consuming resources such as EBS, RDS without having an application centric view and ability to go back and identify causes of dormant resources.

#Application Centric Networking
 
Infrastructure software defined networking limit the ability to allow application stacks to talk to each other across hybrid environments. An application centric networking not only makes it possible to seamlessly connect services across multiple clouds but also drastically simplifies stack based applications’ supply chain.

#Application Centric Operations
 
One of the differentiated features of Appranix AcA that allows customers to recall software after production release relies heavily on application centric operations. By keeping track of configurations across deployments Appranix can easily recall a patch or feature that caused problems in production. Applied machine learning intelligently reconfigures systems using Live Replacetm and Live Repairtm of systems, platforms without affective the application service.
